## ai short story
Under the pale light of the winter moon, Clara trudged down the quiet street, her breath clouding in the night air. She had missed the last bus home, and the small town of Willow Creek was silent except for the crunch of snow beneath her boots. 

Halfway down the block, she noticed a faint glow in the window of the old bakery that had been closed for months. Curiosity pulled her closer. Inside, the air was warm, and the scent of cinnamon filled the room. A single tray of pastries sat on the counter, as if waiting for her.

A man in a flour-dusted apron appeared from the back, smiling gently. “Been waiting for someone to find their way in,” he said. Clara hesitated, then accepted the steaming pastry he offered. The taste was sweet and comforting, and for a brief moment, the cold outside felt like a distant memory.

When she went back the next morning, the bakery was dark and empty again, its windows frosted over. But on the counter sat a single, warm pastry and a note: For the traveler who believes in small miracles.
